## Nations
The <span style="color:red">Kingdom of Darulia</span> is the major nation that controls the continent of Darulia.  
The <span style="color:red">Orcish tribes</span> are a group of individual tribes that control small sporadic pockets of land in of Northern Darulia and Western Darulia. 
## History

Originally a group of migrants escaping war in faerun lead by <span style="color:red">Darul</span> landed on the southern most peninsula of the continent and settled the land quickly growing and expanding over 1000s of years. soon the <span style="color:red">Darulian</span> met the wood elves who lived peacefully on the northern region of the continent now known as <span style="color:red">Haiyandor</span>. Quickly tensions rose as the <span style="color:red">Darulians</span> settled closer and closer to the wood elves region. Eventually the <span style="color:red">Darulians</span> began pushing the wood elves out of there villages and deeper and deeper into <span style="color:red">Haiyandor</span> and eventually out of <span style="color:red">Haiyandor</span> through the <span style="color:red">Gates to the Vale</span> into the region of the <span style="color:red">High Elves](#here). The [High Elves</span> united with the <span style="color:red">Wood Elves</span> under <span style="color:red">The Treaty of the Vale</span>. The newly united elves drove the <span style="color:red">Darulians</span> back down into Darulia proper stalemating for the war effort for tens of years until the <span style="color:red">High Arbiter Akura</span> of the <span style="color:red">Keepers of the Vale</span> engaged with <span style="color:red">Arch-Magi Narlin</span> in a magical battle. Rumors state that both wizards where destroyed in confrontation though there where no surviving eyewitnesses. In fact the results in the battle is what caused the destruction of the Northern Darulia and physical divide between the the two factions ending the <span style="color:red">elvish war of separation</span> and rechristening the two regions as <span style="color:red">Haiyandor</span> and Darulia. The capital city of Darulia was then renamed from Darul's Rest to <span style="color:red">Narlin's Stand</span>


## Races of Darulia
### Primary Races
Darulia is a primarily human kingdom (around 95% of the population being human or of human decent [Half-elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf), [half-orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/2-half-orc), etc...). 
[Gnomes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/18-gnome) and [Dwarves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf) occupy around 4% of the population with the remaining 1% being made up of the other races. With the exception of elves and some of the other more classically hostile races (goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, ect...) none of the races are treated with outright racism. Though there is more of a mistrust of non-human races in the smaller more rural regions and towns.

### Elves in Darulia
Elves are not welcome in Darulia. While elves where the original inhabitants of the land they where never welcome in the Darulia and post the <span style="color:red">elvish war of separation</span> they where outright banned from the kingdom. Some Elves still reside in Darulia but in either exile or in disguise. Of those that do remain in Darulia many are still loyal to <span style="color:red">Haiyandor</span> and lie in wait either as spies or as "sleeper agents" waiting to sew chaos and destruction should the old enemies rekindle their fighting.
