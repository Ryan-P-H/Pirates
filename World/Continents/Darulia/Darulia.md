# Darulia
### Description
Darulia is a large continent on the western side of the [Nimsk-Darulian Sea](/TODO.md).
Darulia is the common name of the entire continent prior to the elvish reclamation of 1523 DR causing both a physical 
and political split of the continent with the greater souther portion maintaining the name of Darulia and the northern 
region being named the in the elvish tongue as [Haiyandor](/TODO.md)
## Regions
### Northern Darulia
Northern Darulia is desert wasteland scared and poxed with pockets of residual arcane magics left from the elvish war of separation of 1449 DR - 1523 DR.
This residual magic zones are known as [Breaches of the Vail](/TODO.md) (see [Faerzress](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faerzress)) a named coined by the local nomads who used roam the area.

Northern Darulia is mostly abandoned with the exception of the [Northen Regiment](/TODO.md) of [The Crowns Expeditionary Force](/TODO.md) who occupy mulitple fortifications that watch over both the [Haiyandor-Darulia Border](/TODO.md) and any incursions from the [Orcish tribes](/TODO.md) that roam the mountainous region known as [The Spine](/TODO.md) to the west of the [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md).  

### Coastal Darulia
Much of the population of Darulia lives on the coastal region stretching from the edge of [Northern Darulia](/TODO.md) down through the southern coast.  
This coastal region littered with settlements of mixed race ranging from fishing villages to the capital city [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md). Inland from the coast are rolling plains and sparse forests.
Due the Geography of the this region much of Darulia economy comes from the farming, fishing and trading that takes place on or near the coasts. And with that much of the main forces of the Crown known as [The Shields of Darul](/TODO.md) reside in this region keeping the peace and enforcing the will of the Crown.

### Western Darulia
The western border of Darulia is an impassible mountain range known as [The Spine](/TODO.md) that skirts the Darulia from the southern coastal region up to the northern border. The region between these mountains and the coastal region is known as Western Darulia. This land consists of small logging and mining villages that supply the rest of Darulia with vial ore, stone and timber. Due to the proximity of this region to [The Spine](/TODO.md) the region is prone to constant raids by the creatures the inhabit [The Spine](/TODO.md).


## history

originally a group of migrants escaping war in faerun lead by [Darul](/TODO.md) landed on the southern most peninsula of the continent and settled the land quickly growing and expanding over 1000s of years. soon the [Darulian](/TODO.md) met the wood elves who lived peacefully on the northern region of the continent now known as [Haiyandor](/TODO.md). Quickly tensions rose as the [Darulians](/TODO.md) settled closer and closer to the wood elves region. Eventually the [Darulians](/TODO.md) began pushing the wood elves out of there villages and deeper and deeper into [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) and eventually out of [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) through the [Gates to the Vale](/TODO.md) into the region of the [High Elves](#here). The [High Elves](/TODO.md) united with the [Wood Elves](/TODO.md) under [The Treaty of the Vale](/TODO.md). The newly united elves drove the [Darulians](/TODO.md) back down into Darulia proper stalemating for the war effort for tens of years until the [High Arbiter Akura](/TODO.md) of the [Keepers of the Vale](/TODO.md) engaged with [Arch-Magi Narlin](/TODO.md) in a magical battle. Rumors state that both wizards where destroyed in confrontation though there where no surviving eyewitnesses. In fact the results in the battle is what caused the destruction of the Northern Darulia and physical divide between the the two factions ending the [elvish war of separation](/TODO.md) and rechristening the two regions as  [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) and Darulia. The capital city of Darulia was then renamed from Darul's Rest to [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md)
