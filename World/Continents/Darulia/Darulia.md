# Darulia
### Description

region being named the in the elvish tongue as [Haiyandor](/TODO.md).

## Nations
The [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) is the major nation that controls the continent of Darulia.  
The [Orcish tribes](/TODO.md) are a group of individual tribes that control small sporadic pockets of land in of Northern Darulia and Western Darulia. 
## History

Originally a group of migrants escaping war in faerun lead by [Darul](/TODO.md) landed on the southern most peninsula of the continent and settled the land quickly growing and expanding over 1000s of years. soon the [Darulian](/TODO.md) met the wood elves who lived peacefully on the northern region of the continent now known as [Haiyandor](/TODO.md). Quickly tensions rose as the [Darulians](/TODO.md) settled closer and closer to the wood elves region. Eventually the [Darulians](/TODO.md) began pushing the wood elves out of there villages and deeper and deeper into [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) and eventually out of [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) through the [Gates to the Vale](/TODO.md) into the region of the [High Elves](#here). The [High Elves](/TODO.md) united with the [Wood Elves](/TODO.md) under [The Treaty of the Vale](/TODO.md). The newly united elves drove the [Darulians](/TODO.md) back down into Darulia proper stalemating for the war effort for tens of years until the [High Arbiter Akura](/TODO.md) of the [Keepers of the Vale](/TODO.md) engaged with [Arch-Magi Narlin](/TODO.md) in a magical battle. Rumors state that both wizards where destroyed in confrontation though there where no surviving eyewitnesses. In fact the results in the battle is what caused the destruction of the Northern Darulia and physical divide between the the two factions ending the [elvish war of separation](/TODO.md) and rechristening the two regions as [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) and Darulia. The capital city of Darulia was then renamed from Darul's Rest to [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md)


## Races of Darulia
### Primary Races
Darulia is a primarily human kingdom (around 95% of the population being human or of human decent [Half-elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf), [half-orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/2-half-orc), etc...). 
[Gnomes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/18-gnome) and [Dwarves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf) occupy around 4% of the population with the remaining 1% being made up of the other races. With the exception of elves and some of the other more classically hostile races (goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, ect...) none of the races are treated with outright racism. Though there is more of a mistrust of non-human races in the smaller more rural regions and towns.

### Elves in Darulia
Elves are not welcome in Darulia. While elves where the original inhabitants of the land they where never welcome in the Darulia and post the [elvish war of separation](/TODO.md) they where outright banned from the kingdom. Some Elves still reside in Darulia but in either exile or in disguise. Of those that do remain in Darulia many are still loyal to [Haiyandor](/TODO.md) and lie in wait either as spies or as "sleeper agents" waiting to sew chaos and destruction should the old enemies rekindle their fighting.
