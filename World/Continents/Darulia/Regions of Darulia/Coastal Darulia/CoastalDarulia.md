# Coastal Darulia
## Summary
Much of the population of Darulia lives on the coastal region stretching from the edge of [Northern Darulia](/World/Continents/Darulia/Regions%20of%20Darulia/Northern%20Darulia/NorthernDarulia.md) down through the southern coast.  
This coastal region littered with settlements of mixed race ranging from fishing villages to the capital city [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md). Inland from the coast are rolling plains and sparse forests.
Due the Geography of the this region much of Darulia economy comes from the farming, fishing and trading that takes place on or near the coasts. And with that much of the main forces of the Crown known as [The Shield's of Darul](/TODO.md) reside in this region keeping the peace and enforcing the will of the Crown.

## Nations
Coastal Darulia is solely controlled by [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) and any incursion from another faction of nation would quickly bring the full force of the Kingdom down upon the attackers.

## Geography

Coastal Darulia is a majority flat region. There are many rivers and steams that flow from the western region through Coastal Darulia into the ocean. This allows for many lush plains, [Open Forests](https://fsi.nic.in/scheme-of-classification) and [Shrublands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland). 

## Economy
Due to its location and geography, Coastal Darulia is the economic crown of the [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md). The economy of the region is split into 3 major parts trade, agriculture, and industry.
### Trade
Due to its location on the coast, this region has access to all major aquatic trade routes servicing the many island states of the [Nimsk-Darulian Sea](/TODO.md) and in extension [Nimsk](/TODO.md) itself. Aside from aquatic trade, Coastal Darulia also imports and exports many resources from [Western Darulia](/World/Continents/Darulia/Regions%20of%20Darulia/Western%20Darulia/WesternDarulia.md). With much of the metals, timber and stone needed being sourced from [Western Darulia](/World/Continents/Darulia/Regions%20of%20Darulia/Western%20Darulia/WesternDarulia.md) and in exchange Coastal Darulia send food and workers back to the west.
### Agriculture
Due to prevalence of fresh water rivers that cut through the region the land is extremely well adapted to farming. Much of the nations grain and meat come from this region along with. Smaller villages that dot the coastline also provide a steady supply of aquatic resources such as fish, pearls, kelp (a national delicacy served in every tavern on the coast).
### Industry
The major industry in the region is the shipbuilding industry. A Darulian made ship is second to none with nobles in lands as afar away as Baldur's Gate purchasing them for there own use. The shipbuilders guild wields immense power in the region second to only the Crown. Out side of shipbuilding many other industries thrive due to easy access to materials by both aquatic and land trade with [Western Darulia](/World/Continents/Darulia/Regions%20of%20Darulia/Western%20Darulia/WesternDarulia.md).
## Underground Economy
Due to this regions coastal location and as the seat for the capital of [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) there also exists an underground economy. Some of this underground economy is relatively mundane such as running of counterfeit goods (counterfeit Darulian Kelp exists), drug running, or smuggling people across borders. But the major driver of the underground economy is the export of [Pirates](/TODO.md). 
## Regional Government
As the sole controlling government of the region the [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) is the only Official governing body in the region. While the Crown is the one power to rule them all in the [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) the governing of the majority of this region is delegated to [Duke Kristof](/TODO.md). The only exception to [Duke Kristof's](/TODO.md) control is the City of [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md) which is under the control of [Dutchess Tarnton](/TODO.md) 
### Official Government
[Duke Kristof's](/TODO.md) main job is to coordinate and supervise the marquises who run the states within the region. He also pass on orders from the crown along with making his own rulings over the region. [Dutchess Tarnton](/TODO.md) presides over the city of [Narlin's Stand](/TODO.md) the capital of the [Kingdom of Darulia](/TODO.md) and only answers to the Crown itself.
### Nongovernmental Influences
While the Crown maintains it is the sole power and decision maker in any of its regions and it would be suicidal to suggest otherwise outside of closed doors. There are many other powers that influence [Duke Kristof](/TODO.md) and the marquises. The two most influential powers (and non coincidentally the richest) are the [shipbuilders guild](/TODO.md) and the [Soundglade Family](/TODO.md). Though theses are the two largest influences on decision making anyone with some gold and their pocket and an officials ear to whisper into can help shape policy at most levels of the government (of course the bigger the decision and higher the level of government the deeper your pocket will need to be)
