### Northern Darulia
Northern Darulia is desert wasteland scared and poxed with pockets of residual arcane magics left from the elvish war of separation of 1449 DR - 1523 DR.
This residual magic zones are known as <span style="color:red">Breaches of the Veil</span> (see [Faerzress](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faerzress)) a named coined by the local nomads who used roam the area.

Northern Darulia is mostly abandoned with the exception of the <span style="color:red">Northen Regiment</span> of <span style="color:red">The Crown's Expeditionary Force</span> who occupy mulitple fortifications that watch over both the <span style="color:red">Haiyandor-Darulia Border</span> and any incursions from the <span style="color:red">Orcish tribes</span> that roam the mountainous region known as <span style="color:red">The Spine</span> to the west of the <span style="color:red">Kingdom of Darulia</span>.  



### Western Darulia
The western border of Darulia is an impassible mountain range known as <span style="color:red">The Spine</span> that skirts the Darulia from the southern coastal region up to the northern border. The region between these mountains and the coastal region is known as Western Darulia. This land consists of small logging and mining villages that supply the rest of Darulia with vial ore, stone and timber. Due to the proximity of this region to <span style="color:red">The Spine</span> the region is prone to constant raids by the creatures the inhabit <span style="color:red">The Spine</span>.
